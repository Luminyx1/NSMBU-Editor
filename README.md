# NSMBU-Editor
Editor for many formats present in NSMBU.  
Only runs on Windows at the moment. (Runs on Wii U too currently, but for the sake of testing RIO)  

## Supported formats
* PTCL (effects file, currently viewing only, place it in `./fs/content/Eset_Cafe.ptcl`)  

## Dependencies
* [RIO](https://github.com/aboood40091/rio)  
* [NintendoWare Eft](https://github.com/nw4f/Eft/tree/nsmbu-win-port)  
* Same dependencies as RIO.  

## Building
(TODO: Current Makefile is for building for Wii U)  
* Add `include` and `include/win` to your header paths.  
* Same building procedure as RIO.
